##### *There's a lot to unpack here, so I hope you're ready for a semi-long read. :)*

This logo was designed to be complex, but also simplistic enough to look at to be recognizable, and easy on the eyes. I designed it specifically to be asymmetrical to add more interest, but balanced the assets enough to make the logo appear somewhat static. I wanted it to show off my skills, but also not to go too far out of the realm of a logo. Designing this type of balance took a combination of 2D AND 3D assets, with careful placement and care of these designs. 
###### *[For more information on what I mean by dynamic vs static, you can find that here.](https://www.buycustomlogo.com/blog/what-is-a-dynamic-and-static-logo/)*

This logo is broken into two parts, the city (which is most of the logo), and everything else, which will be self explanatory.

The city itself was the main challenge when creating this design. I wanted something detailed enough to interest the viewer, to tell a story when you zoom in, but also simple enough where it can be recognizable as a whole when you aren't really looking at the details of the design.

The city, pictured above, consists of skyscrapers, houses, signs, lamp posts, benches, and even futuristic-styled hovercrafts. Each building and asset was carefully placed to give the city the feeling of being large, but also the diversity a city comes with. The right side has more home-styled buildings, while the left side more of a  commercial/business side to the city. All of this, combined with the closure the 3 large buildings provide, creates a cityscape that I would say I am proud of.

Speaking of those 3 comically large buildings.. what are they? Why are they so big? What purpose do they serve other than to add balance to the design, and separate the city? Well, If you turn the city 90 degrees clockwise, you will see this;

What? You still cant see it? Let me flip it vertically and hide the unimportant bits here really quick:

![Now I see it!](/assets/images/City E2.png)

Yep! That's right, its the letter "E". Wow! If you already saw it before, then kudos to you! Not everybody notices it until I point it out to them, and that's by design. Its supposed to be sort-of in the "background", but also serve the purpose of adding balance in the form of visual weight, separation for the city, and asymmetry to add visual interest. Combined with the clouds in the full logo, this creates a landscape that is not also aesthetically pleasing to look it, but also gets the point across of what I represent, what I am capable of, and what I want to do.
###### *(Also, yes, the "E" stands for Eren.)*

If you've read this far, then you probably like my design, and I truly and honestly appreciate it! It motivates me to create more, and keeps me going, and if you're someone who has known me for awhile, or known my artwork, then you will know my old logo:

This old design was created back in 2018, when I was first REALLY kicking off learning design. I had just graduated HighSchool, finished my After Effects course, and was on my way to college. This design stuck with me for awhile, but I have always felt like it was missing something. It had no meaning, other than it "looked cool". It was simple, but communicated nothing. The squares had no meaning, and the shapes were cool, but anybody could design this, and honestly I would not have been surprised if somebody else did. I am proud of my younger self for completing it, and I learned a lot through it's design (and animation), but It did not represent me and who I was.. that was, except, the *triangle*. Yes, the ***triangle***.

You see, this is not my first logo that I used, in fact, there is an older design, which I whipped up in [paint.net](getpaint.net) about seven years ago:

![Yikes...](/assets/images/OLDPLAYBUTTON.png)

Yikes! This design was created to represent a "play" button, because it was my passion. I wanted to create media, design, and especially, I wanted to create animations. I'm not sure what made me go with a play button, but hey! It has stuck with me, and although I don't approve of my old design, without it, I would not be who I am today, and this little *(ahem.. long)* wall of text would not even be here..

..But why am I rambling about some weird triangle/play button? Well, dear reader, I am here to finally reveal the last, but the most important part of my logo..

.. It is...

![The Triforce of.. coolness](/assets/images/Triangle.png)

A triangle. Yep. Without that silly triangle, I would not be here today. Those magic sides represent not just my early childhood, but the start of a long journey that I'm still on, and I intend to carry this funny little triangle with me, no matter what changes or how far I go.

In the end, a logo is just a logo, but it's also a representation of who you are, what you've been through, and who you strive to be. It represents what you do, and to me, at least right now, this current logo represents everything to me.
