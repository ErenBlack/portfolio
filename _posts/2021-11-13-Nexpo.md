This logo was originally not created by me, however, I took the liberty on myself to animate it anyways. There is not much to say about the logo itself here since it is not an original design, however, the animation was inspired by a "moon", more specifically a "crescent" opening up to reveal the name "Nexpo".

This concept can actually be seen in his later revisions of his logo, which may not be his most up-to-date logo, but still you can find [here](https://business.facebook.com/NexpoYT/photos/2654603714819252/) and [here](https://business.facebook.com/NexpoYT/photos/2654600218152935/).
